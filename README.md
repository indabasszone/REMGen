# REMGen

This was my self-directed capstone project for the DCC (Design Cultures & Creativity) honors program at UMD. It is a random music generator that attempts to elicit emotions in users that they select within the program. It operates almost entirely on music theory, as the main goal of the project was to see how effective computer generated music can be at eliciting emotions with minimal human input.

To run the program, download the music_generator folder and run music_generator.pde. The data folder is very large, yes, but it is necessary for the program to run (that's where all the sound files and images are stored).

The instrument.pde files show the functionality for those specific instruments.
The GUI (whose source code is displayed in gui.pde) was generated using the g4p library.
